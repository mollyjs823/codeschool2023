# Simple Vue App

Use the following screenshot and specifications listed below to build a simple Vue app:

1. Feel free to use the Vue boilerplate code here: https://github.com/mollyjs823/codeschool2023/tree/main/vue-boilerplate

2. Make a welcome message that is able to change. Hint: {{ ... }} and a data property

3. Create a text input that the user can enter their name in. Hint: v-model and a data property

4. When the user submits their name (you'll need a submit button to go along with the input), the welcome message should update with their name in it. Hint: v-on:click and a function

5. Create a list of colors (at least 3) and display each one on the page. Hint: v-for and a new data array

6. When the user clicks one of those colors, the background color of an area of page should change to that color. Hint: v-on:click and v-bind:style="backgroundColor: something"

7. You can style it however you'd like as long as it's clean and easy to use

8. Send a copy of your compressed/zipped project folder to molly@thebanyanteam.com


If you have time:
* Add a feature that would use a v-if && v-else 
* Add more input fields that do something (maybe the user can input their own color instead of choosing one that already exists)
