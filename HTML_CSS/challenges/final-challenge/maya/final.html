            <p class="me-p">I am currently a student at Utah Tech University in St. George Utah where I plan to study Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I currently work at Starbucks where I have been working for almost three years. I have been in my current position as a Shift Supervisor for two years, though. I tend to keep very busy, but in my free time I love to hang out with my friends and family, crochet, or be outside.</p>
