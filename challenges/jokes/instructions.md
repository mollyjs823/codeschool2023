# Jokes App

Use the following screenshot and specifications listed below to help build a jokes app:

![TODOMockup](https://code.mollyshewchuk.com/resources/jokes.jpg)
1. When Vue loads, fetch a random list (make a GET request) from the joke API at "https://code.mollyshewchuk.com/jokes" - it will return 20 jokes to you. You need to turn these into JSON format since they'll come to you as a string. (fetch().then()...)

2. As soon as you have the list, display one of those jokes on the screen (you can randomly select one by index)

3. If the user clicks on a "new joke" button, the currently displayed joke should update with a new one

4. Create a search input that would allow the user to search through the entire list of jokes. Display the results back to the user (refer to a simple search example on GitHub here: https://github.com/mollyjs823/codeschool2023/tree/main/simple-search)


To get more complicated / if you have time:

5. Allow the user to sort the entire jokes list alphabetically

6. Allow the user to input their own jokes using an input field

7. Let the user give either a positive or negative rating to a joke, turning it red or green in the list accordingly


* You can style it however you'd like as long as it's clean and easy to use.
