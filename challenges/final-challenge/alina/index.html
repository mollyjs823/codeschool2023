          I am on the track to graduate with a Computer Science degree by Spring
          2026.

          I was born in SLC, UT and from 2009 to present I have moved about
          every 2 years. I have lived in 6 states now and my top 2 states are
          Oregon and Virginia. I've known I wanted to be in the CS field since
          5th grade. The CS field has always seemed like an open-minded
          environment where you continually learn every day. That is something I
          love to do and why I applied and got accepted into Code School this
          summer. My career goal is to become a Software Engineer. I love
          travelling, hiking, trying new foods, coding, and ice skating. Don't
          hate me, but I like cats slightly more than dogs because of their
          purring.

          Because of the travelling/moving in my life, I've learned of the
          million ways to be judged and have how not to care. It's been a great
          asset in my life and has raised my self-confidence so much.

          Seeing my mother in the CS/Business fields was my main inspiration to
          joining the CS field. I also appreciated the deep respect her
          colleagues had for her. She was never treated differently because of
          her gender. I knew the cs field could be a safe place for me to work
          in. My mom is also able to travel all the time because she is able to
          be remote for work. That's a great plus!

          This summer I've learned that I am so bad at not doing anything. I
          decided to pick up two jobs, go to Code School, I have my mother's
          graduation from UCLA, I make plans to do either a hike or something
          new and different for Saturdays, and I visit my grandma in Mesquite,
          NV every other weekend.

          I guess a weird talent of mine is i'm fairly good at guessing people's
          zodiac signs. I also know a little bit of French and Spanish. I know
          enough of these languages to survive but that's about it. I've also
          put it in my goals this summer to learn more Spanish so I go to
          <a href="http://www.200words-a-day.com/daily-spanish-lesson.html"
            >200 Words A Day</a
          >
          for my verb to learn for the day. I also recently bought
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Erika-L-S%C3%A1nchez/dp/0525564322"
            >Yo no soy tu perfecta hija mexicana by Erika L. Sanchez</a
          >
          to get better at understanding Spanish.

          I am grateful for my family because they are very accepting of
          differences. I have people in my family who are Christian, Jewish,
          LDS, bi-racial, multi-racial, and part of the LGBTQ+ community.
          Growing up in an environment like that was very eye-opening and
          heart-warming.
